        <p>I am 11 years old and i enjoy a couple things selectively like rding my bike. There is nothing in this world that feels better to ride your biske speedy fast with your friend with your hair blowing back and your mouth shouthing "whooo". there are not maany things i enjoy but this is one thing i love to to. I always love my solo rides when i am out alone singing to my self and riding peacefully. i love to bike ride, my bike sze is somewhere between a 20-24 inch. i am the fastest after one of my friends (thats because he has a bigger bike) it is winter now so i will take a break from that but overall i love to bike and it is my number one hobby!
